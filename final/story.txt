No one knew where she had come from. The rumors that circulated about her were many and full of wild tales. Some thought she was a ghost, others thought she was a product of a specialized program designed to train the best spies on the planet. Whenever Mitya heard a new rumor or was asked about her past she would smile. A smile that spoke of secrets and silence. She would never willingly tell others why she was there. Her life, as well as others, depended on it. If the PRG ever found out that she had a sister who had survived a raid, there would be questions asked. And if it came to that Mitya did not know if she would be able to stop herself from showing her hatred for the PRG. She was here for one purpose, to learn all she could about the PRG so she could destroy it. She had contacts with rival governments which were always happy to hear any new information she sent their way, and one day, the PRG would be no more. It would never again be able to destroy families, lives, or spirits, it would cease to exist and maybe, in time, the world would heal from what they had done.
